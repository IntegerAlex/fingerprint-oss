# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, experience level, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- **Empathy and Kindness:** Showing understanding and compassion toward others.
- **Respect:** Valuing differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- **Constructive Feedback:** Offering and accepting feedback graciously.
- **Responsibility:** Owning up to mistakes, apologizing, and learning from them.
