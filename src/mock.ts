/**
 * Generates and returns a mock system information object for testing.
 *
 * The returned object simulates various aspects of a system including browser details (e.g., user agent, platform, languages, timezone), 
 * device properties (e.g., screen resolution, hardware concurrency, device memory), and support for features such as cookies, local and session storage, 
 * indexedDB, WebGL, canvas, and audio. It also includes updated operating system details under the "os" property along with additional fields 
 * like plugin list, touch capabilities, vendor information, font preferences, incognito mode status, and bot detection metrics. The object also incorporates 
 * a mathematical constants fingerprint generated by {@link getMathFingerprint}.
 *
 * @returns A mock object representing system information for testing purposes.
